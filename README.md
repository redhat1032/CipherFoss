# 🔐 CipherFoss

> A voxel-based, cybersecurity-themed sandbox adventure where you reclaim the fractured grid block by block.

## 🌍 Project Overview

**CipherFoss** drops players into a corrupted digital world overrun by rogue AIs, zero-day viruses, and broken security systems. As a white-hat operative resurrected from raw code, your mission is to secure, rebuild, and ultimately master the grid using hacking tools, voxel-based defenses, and programmable constructs.

## 🚀 Core Features (In Development)

- 🧱 Voxel-based 3D world (chunked terrain, destructible blocks)
- 🔐 Cyber-themed buildables (firewalls, IDS towers, honeynets)
- 🧠 AI enemies (malware, kernel wraiths, exploit swarms)
- ⚔️ Craftable tools (packet sniffer blade, exploit launcher)
- 🗺️ Procedural digital biomes (Mainframe Wastes, CryptoVaults)
- 👾 Boss battles with advanced threats (Zero-Day AI, Null Sovereign)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Godot 4
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub ([redhat1032](https://github.com/redhat1032))
- **Target Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Web (via WebGL)
